    p This is a demo project similar to 
        a(href="http://wx.qq.com/" target="_blank") WeChat's web log in interface
        . We wish to demonstrate how different webpages/sessions (potentially one on the desktop and one on the mobile) can communicate with each other, thus to achieve a smoother user experience.

    p Click the following link to open a second (pop-up) window, which conceptually should be done on your mobile phone. When you follow the instructions (i.e. click a button) on the pop-up window, which stands for doing some extra interactions on the mobile end, this webpage will prompt the success of log in.

    a(href="/cross/popup" target="_blank") Launch a pop-up window

    p(id="text" style='color:red') No status update. Click the link above.
